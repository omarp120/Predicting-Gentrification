# There Goes the Neighborhood: Predicting Gentrification in the United States
One of the biggest challenges with gentrification is that people are not aware that it is happening in a community until it is too late to address it and native residents have already been displaced. If local governments are aware that their communities are likely to become gentrified, they can allocate resources, gather community input and enact policies to avoid widespread displacement of native residents. We will develop a model to predict which U.S. counties are at risk of becoming gentrified based on several predictors such as ‘neighborhood disparity in poverty’ and ‘gini index’.
